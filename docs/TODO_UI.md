**What we built:**

- **Chat History Sidebar**: Desktop/mobile sidebar showing recent 20 AI conversations
- **Session Management**: Load previous chats, create new conversations, persistent Firebase storage
- **Smart Image Display**: 1:1 aspect ratio thumbnails (48x48px) with minimal screen usage
- **Full-Screen AI Layout**: Dedicated workspace eliminating gap with main navigation
- **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Bottom navigation integration without top bar clutter

**Key Features Implemented:**

**🖥️ Desktop Experience:**

- **Professional Sidebar**: 64px minimized state with icon indicators, 320px expanded state
- **Chat Type Indicators**: Color-coded dots (green=plant analysis, blue=consumer chat)
- **Smart Minimization**: Starts minimized by default, expandable with chat history details
- **Self-Contained Toggle**: Sidebar manages its own expand/collapse with smooth transitions
- **Session Loading**: Click any chat to load previous conversation with all messages
- **Full-Screen Workspace**: Dedicated AILayout eliminates gap with main navigation sidebar

**📱 Mobile Experience:**

- **Slide-Out Panel**: Left overlay with dark background, hamburger menu access
- **Touch-Optimized**: Proper touch targets and smooth animations
- **Auto-Close Behavior**: Sidebar closes automatically after selecting a chat
- **Bottom Navigation**: Full mobile navigation available without top bar interference
- **Clean Interface**: Maximum screen space dedicated to chat conversation

**🔧 Advanced Session Features:**

- **Persistent Storage**: All conversations saved to Firebase `/users/{uid}/aiChats`
- **Smart Titles**: Auto-generated from first message content (50 char limit)
- **Date Formatting**: Smart time display (Today, Yesterday, X days ago)
- **New Chat Function**: Clean slate conversations with proper session management
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading while fetching chat history
- **Empty States**: Proper messaging when no conversations exist

**📐 UI Improvements:**

- **Compact Images**: Reduced chat message images from large grids to 48x48px squares
- **Better Chat Colors**: User messages now subtle gray instead of harsh white
- **1:1 Image Ratio**: Uniform square thumbnails using Next.js `fill` with `object-cover`
- **Space Efficiency**: Images take minimal screen real estate while remaining visible
- **Touch-Friendly**: All interactions optimized for mobile touch targets

**🏗️ Technical Implementation:**

**New Components:**

- `components/ai/chat-sidebar.tsx` - Complete sidebar with desktop/mobile modes
- `components/layout/ai-layout.tsx` - Dedicated full-screen layout for AI assistant

**Updated Components:**

- `components/ai/chat.tsx` - Integrated sidebar, improved image display, session management
- `app/ai-assistant/page.tsx` - Uses new AILayout for gap-free desktop experience

**Desktop Sidebar Behavior:**

- **Minimized State**: 64px width with MessageSquare icon and recent chat dots
- **Expanded State**: 320px width with full chat list, titles, timestamps
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions (300ms) for width changes
- **No Layout Shifts**: Content appears/disappears without jarring movements

**Mobile Integration:**

- **AILayout**: No top bar on mobile, full bottom navigation available
- **Space Optimization**: Chat gets full screen height minus bottom nav (64px)
- **Natural UX**: Users navigate normally without needing back buttons or settings

**Firebase Integration:**

- **Query Optimization**: Loads recent 20 chats ordered by `lastUpdated` desc
- **Real-time Loading**: Async loading when sidebar opens, cached during session
- **Session Persistence**: Complete message history preserved across browser sessions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when Firebase queries fail

**Translation Support:**

- `ai.chatHistory`, `ai.newChat`, `ai.noChats` - Sidebar interface
- `common.today`, `common.yesterday`, `common.daysAgo` - Smart time formatting
- `auth.signOut` - AILayout desktop sign out functionality
