### Payments & Premium (Stripe / MercadoPago)

- Premium access is controlled via Firebase custom claims.
- Automatic granting via webhooks:
  - Stripe: `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` marks `premium: true` for active subscriptions; revokes on cancellation.
  - MercadoPago: `app/api/mercadopago/webhook/route.ts` supports both:
    - `payment`/`authorized_payment` approved ‚Üí grants premium and sets `premium_until` ‚âà 31 days.
    - `preapproval` active/authorized ‚Üí grants premium. Cancelled/paused does not auto‚Äërevoke; access expires by `premium_until` or admin toggle.
- Client reads premium via `hooks/use-premium.ts` (checks `premium` or `premium_until > now`).
- After returning from MercadoPago, `/premium?status=completed` triggers claim sync and token refresh.

Configuration
- Env var: `MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN` (production token APP_USR‚Äë‚Ä¶)
- Webhook URL (MercadoPago): `https://www.cannafriend.app/api/mercadopago/webhook`
- For Stripe, configure your webhook secret and price ID per your account.

Admin Tools
- Unified search at `/admin` lets you search MercadoPago payments and subscriptions by email or UID (`external_reference`), view status/date, and Reprocess to grant premium if appropriate.
